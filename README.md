With RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), you can test various scenarios to ensure that users with different roles have appropriate access to resources. Here are some functions and scenarios you can try:

1. **Assign Roles and Permissions:**
   - Create roles (e.g., admin, user) and permissions.
   - Assign permissions to roles.

2. **Check Role-Based Permissions:**
   - Use RBAC functions to check if a role has a specific permission.
   - Verify that an admin has access to admin permissions, and a user has access to user permissions.

3. **Add and Remove Roles:**
   - Add a new role dynamically and assign permissions to it.
   - Remove a role and verify that the associated permissions are no longer accessible.

4. **User Access Control:**
   - Simulate authentication and set user roles based on the login credentials.
   - Test access to routes based on user roles using the RBAC middleware.

5. **Combining Permissions:**
   - Create a permission that combines multiple lower-level permissions.
   - Check if a role has access to this higher-level permission.

6. **Dynamic Permission Checks:**
   - Implement dynamic checks based on user attributes or context (beyond static RBAC configurations).

7. **Testing Edge Cases:**
   - Test scenarios where a user has multiple roles.
   - Test scenarios where a user has conflicting roles or permissions.

8. **RBAC Policy Management:**
   - Implement RBAC policy management, such as allowing certain roles to modify roles and permissions.

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```go
// Assume rbac is your gorbac.RBAC instance

// 1. Assign Roles and Permissions
adminRole := gorbac.NewStdRole("admin")
userRole := gorbac.NewStdRole("user")

adminPerm := gorbac.NewStdPermission("adminPermission")
userPerm := gorbac.NewStdPermission("userPermission")

adminRole.Assign(adminPerm)
userRole.Assign(userPerm)

rbac.Add(adminRole)
rbac.Add(userRole)

// 2. Check Role-Based Permissions
isAdminPermission := rbac.IsGranted("admin", adminPerm, nil)
isUserPermission := rbac.IsGranted("user", userPerm, nil)

// 3. Add and Remove Roles
newRole := gorbac.NewStdRole("newRole")
newRole.Assign(userPerm)

rbac.Add(newRole)

// Assume userRole is a role previously added
rbac.Remove(userRole)

// 4. User Access Control
// Assume checkAuth and enforceRBAC middleware functions are implemented
// Simulate authentication logic
// For example, if the X-User-Role header is "admin" or "user", the user will be granted that role.
userRole := "admin" // Simulate authenticated user role

// Set the user role in the context for later use
context := echo.New().AcquireContext()
context.Request().Header.Set("X-User-Role", userRole)
checkAuth(enforceRBAC(rbac, userPerm))(context)

// 5. Combining Permissions
combinedPerm := gorbac.NewStdPermission("combinedPermission")
combinedPerm.AddPermission(userPerm)
combinedPerm.AddPermission(adminPerm)

isAdminUserCombinedPerm := rbac.IsGranted("admin", combinedPerm, nil)
```

Adapt these examples based on your actual RBAC implementation and application requirements. Testing different scenarios will help ensure that your RBAC system functions as expected.
